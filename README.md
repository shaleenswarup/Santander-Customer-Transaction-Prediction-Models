# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction

The data is taken from the kaggle competition in the link https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview 

At Santander the mission is to help people and businesses prosper. They are always looking for ways to help our customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals.

The goal is to predict what types of customers should be targeted for promotions and what new types of customers Santander should be targeting.

The challenge for the project is binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?

In this challenge, we tried to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. 

The presentation and video is available in youtube https://youtu.be/562t48YPln4 for more details and the code can be found the "Results" directory.

The team members for the project are Tommy Entwistle, Shaleen Swarup, Koller Adzick and myself, Harshitha Kuriminisetty.
